Riding Safety
==========================

1. The KickScooter is a recreational product. Before mastering riding skills, you need to practice. Neither Ninebot Inc. (means Ninebot (Beijing) Tech Co., Ltd. and its subsidiaries and affiliates) nor Segway Inc. is responsible for any injuries or damage caused by a rider's inexperience or failure to follow the instructions in this document.

2. Please understand that you can reduce the risk by following all the instructions and warnings in this manual, but you cannot eliminate all the risks. Remember that whenever you ride the KickScooter you risk injury or death from loss of control, collisions, and falls. When entering into public spaces always comply with the local laws and regulations. As with other vehicles, faster speeds require longer braking distance. Sudden braking on smooth surfaces could lead to wheel slip, loss of balance, or falls. Be cautious and always keep a safe distance between you and other people or vehicles when riding. Be alert and slow down when entering unfamiliar areas.

3. Always wear a helmet when riding. Use an approved bicycle or skateboard helmet that fits properly with the chin strap in place, and provides protection for the back of your head.

4. Do not attempt your first ride in any area where you might encounter children, pedestrians, pets, vehicles, bicycles, or other obstacles and potential hazards.

5. Respect pedestrians by always yielding the right of way.  When approaching a pedestrian from the front, stay to the right and slow down. Avoid startling pedestrians. When approaching from behind, announce yourself and slow down to walking speed when passing. Pass on the left whenever possible. Please obey local traffic laws and regulations.

6. In places without laws and regulations governing self-balancing electric vehicles, comply with the safety guidelines outlined in this manual. Neither Ninebot nor Segway Inc. is responsible for any property damage, personal injury/death, accidents, or legal disputes caused by violations of the safety instructions.

7. Do not allow anyone to ride your KickScooter on his/her own unless he/she has carefully read this manual, and followed the New Rider Tutorial by scanning the QR Code on the Welcome Card. The safety of new riders is your responsibility. Assist new riders until they are comfortable with the basic operation of the KickScooter. Make sure each new rider wears a helmet and other protective gear.

8. Before each ride check for loose fasteners and damaged components. If the KickScooter makes abnormal sounds or signals an alarm, stop riding immediately and contact after-sales service.

9. Be alert! Scan both far ahead and in front of your KickScooter â€” your eyes are your best tool for safely avoiding obstacles and low traction surfaces (including, but not limited to, wet ground, loose sand, loose gravel, and ice).

10. To reduce risk of injury, you must read and follow all "CAUTION"(      ), "Tips"(*), and "WARNING"(      ) notices in this document. Do not ride at an unsafe speed. Under no circumstance should you ride on roads with motor vehicles. The manufacturer recommends riders be 6+ years old. Always follow these safety instructions:

 A) People who should not ride the KickScooter include:

  (- Anyone under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

  (- Anyone who suffers from disease that puts himself/herself at risk if he/she engages in strenuous physical activity.

  (- Anyone who has problems with balance or with motor skills that would interfere with their ability to maintain balance.

  (- Anyone whose weight is outside the stated limits (see Specifications).
  
  (- Pregnant women.

 B) Riders under the age of 16 years old should ride under adult supervision.

 C) Comply with local laws and regulations when riding this product. Do not ride where prohibited by local laws.

 D) To ride safely, you must be able to clearly see what is in front of you and you must be clearly visible to others.

 E) Do not ride in the snow, in the rain, or on roads which are wet, muddy, icy, or that are slippery for any reason. Do not ride over obstacles (including, but not limited to, sand, loose gravel, or sticks). Doing so could result in a loss of balance or traction and could cause a fall.

11. Do not attempt to charge your KickScooter, if it, the charger, or the power outlet is wet.

12. As with any electronic device, use a surge protector when charging to help protect your KickScooter from damage due to power surges and voltage spikes. Only use the Segway supplied charger. Do not use a charger from any other product.

13. Use only Ninebot or Segway approved parts and accessories. Do not modify your KickScooter. Modifications to your KickScooter could interfere with the operation of the KickScooter, resulting in serious injury and/or damage, and could void the Limited Warranty.v
